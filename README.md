## Prompt
The city of Woodstock, NY is preparing to start a new open concert series, SNHU-a-palooza. The concerts will run on the first Friday of every month in a farmer’s field. Admission to the concerts will be free, but the city wants to limit the attendance to 50,000 people, given that previous events with a larger audience caused significant damage to the farm. Toward this end, the city is requiring that interested individuals be registered as attending the event.

Your task is to develop a website for this SNHU-a-palooza concert series. This website must provide the needed information and functionality for users to register themselves as attending the concert of their choosing. Registered users will need a printout of their confirmation, which will contain a control number to ensure that the number of people at these events remains at acceptable levels. Concert staff will check in attendants at the park entrance utilizing tablets. Website users will also only register for single events, not for the whole series. Your website must consist of the following five pages: a homepage, a details page, a registration form, and a confirmation page with a print view form.

## My Work
I completed this assignment in 10 weeks during one of my semesters in grad school. I started from a boilerplate template and added the additional pages and styling, as necessary. For the class, I had to create a website with 3 pages: Homepage, Experience, and Tickets. 

 1. Homepage – This page is the landing page that was user first visited on the site.

 3. Experience – This page has additional information about the concert and an embedded video to show what the concert is about.

It also shows a Google Calendar embed that shows what events are happening during the festival.

 4. Tickets – This page is where users can register for the concert to get tickets, using the provided form. The form uses PHP and SQL in the backend to collect user's email and other information.
